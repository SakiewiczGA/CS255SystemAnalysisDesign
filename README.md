# CS255SystemAnalysisDesign
DriverPass was a customer that wanted a website to cater to people looking to get their drivers license.  The site would offer three packages, all with driving lesson hours, and one including an online course with materials and practice tests.  
The business requirements document was done the best I think.  I would choose the technical requirements to redo as well as possibly the class diagram.  I always want to make some functions classes, although I think I avoided that this time, I feel I may have missed a class.  I really could use better examples for a UML class diagram for a smaller website such as this.  
The user's needs were interpreted into the design with the help of activity diagrams, expecially purchasing a package and reserving driving lessons.  The user's needs are important to consider as it will ensure the business' requirements will be included and the funcitonality will be proper.  
I think starting with business requirements, then doing analysis, then designing are where I would start.  I also believe that requirements can change so an agile methodology really is the best way to go about designing and programming a project.
